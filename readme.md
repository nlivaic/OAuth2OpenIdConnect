### Setting up Identity Server 4

- dotnet CLI templates exist, that can be installed using `dotnet new -u IdentityServer4.Templates`. You can check if these are installed by running `dotnet new`.
- Install the one we want with `dotnet new is4empty`. This one is without any UI, we'll install that later.
- Make sure the IDP project's name is neutral, because IDP will be used by multiple clients.
- Install UI with `dotnet new is4ui`.
- The template installs an Identity Server with a basic, in-memory setup.
  - Define Ids, Apis and Clients in `Config.cs`, but only as a first-hand solution to get started with development.
  - Developer signing keys.
  - `UseIdentityServer()` to set up middleware.
- Https is already enabled by the `.UseIdentityServer()` middleware.
- We can go to `.well-known/openid-configuration` to get basic data on endpoints.
- Add UI by installing template: `dotnet new is4ui`:
  - To get the UI working you have to uncomment **all** the commented out lines in `Startup.ConfigureServices` and `Startup.Configure`.
- Test users are added in `TestUsers.cs`:
  - Remove these and add your own.
  - Add your own claims if you want. Make sure you add a `SubjectId` to each test user.
  - Once you are done, add the test users to the identity server by calling `.AddTestUsers(TestUsers.Users)` in `Startup.ConfigureServices()`.
- Identity resources in `Config.cs`:
  - Identity resources are mapped to scopes that give access to identity-related information.
  - `IdentityResources.OpenId()` is mandatory because we are using OIDC. This scope gives us access to user identifier (`subject_id` claim).
  - `IdentityResources.Profile()` gives access to profile-related claims, e.g. `given_name`, `family_name`.
- API resources in `Config.cs`:
  - API resources are mapped to scopes that give access to APIs.
- After you have configured any new scopes and claims, you can go to `.well-known/openid-configuration` and you should see both there, under `scopes-supported` and `claims-supported`.

### Open points

- root folder `tempkey.rsa` - what is that?
